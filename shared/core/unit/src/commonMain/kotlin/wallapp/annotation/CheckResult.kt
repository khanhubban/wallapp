/**
 * Denotes that the annotated method returns a result that it typically is
 * an error to ignore. This is usually used for methods that have no side effect,
 * so calling it without actually looking at the result usually means the developer
 * has misunderstood what the method does.
 *
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * public @CheckResult String trim(String s) { return s.trim(); }
 * ...
 * s.trim(); // this is probably an error
 * s = s.trim(); // ok
 * ```

     * For example, ProcessBuilder has a method named `redirectErrorStream()`
     * which sounds like it might redirect the error stream. It does not. It's just
     * a getter which returns whether the process builder will redirect the error stream,
     * and to actually set it, you must call `redirectErrorStream(boolean)`.
     * In that case, the method should be defined like this:
     * ```
     * @CheckResult(suggest="#redirectErrorStream(boolean)")
     * public boolean redirectErrorStream() { ... }
     * ```
