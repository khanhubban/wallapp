/**
 * Denotes that the class, method or field has its visibility relaxed, so that it is more widely
 * visible than otherwise necessary to make code testable.
 *
 * You can optionally specify what the visibility **should** have been if not for
 * testing; this allows tools to catch unintended access from within production
 * code.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * @VisibleForTesting(otherwise = VisibleForTesting.PROTECTED)
 * public String printDiagnostics() { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * If not specified, the intended visibility is assumed to be private.
